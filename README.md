# IntelliCue
A service that uses Slack/email messages (fully anonymized) to deliver a weekly feedback report to company executives to improve their employee experience and product. The report has two sections: one, the most common pieces of employee feedback for the week as well as customer interaction analysis; and two, ideas for easy actionable next steps.
